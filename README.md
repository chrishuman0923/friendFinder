# friendFinder

friendFinder is an application that brings the fron-end and back-end of web development together. The front-end is made up of 2 html files that get served by the back-end server files using Express.js. The back-end files handle all of the url routing and returning of JSON data to the front-end.The app is deplkyed on Heroku [here](https://pure-escarpment-26498.herokuapp.com/).

# Notes
All pathways are being parsed using Node "Path". This insures that no matter what OS is running the application, the "/" or "\" will be correct for the OS to navigate between the files.
